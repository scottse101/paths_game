The Horror House

::Entry Hall
You step into a foreboding mansion, its walls adorned with eerie, writhing vines. The atmosphere is thick with an unsettling aura as you cautiously make your way forward. In the center of the room, you spot a strange altar adorned with grotesque statues. Trembling, you approach the altar, and to your horror, the statues come to life. Their eyes glow with malevolence as they lunge at you, their claws and fangs ready to tear you apart. Panic grips your heart, but you refuse to succumb. With quick thinking and agile movements, you evade their attacks, striking back with determination. One by one, the statues crumble into dust until only silence reigns.

You attempt to flee, but your movements are sluggish, as if trapped in a never-ending nightmare. The figures draw nearer, their ghostly touch seeping into your very soul. With a surge of determination, you gather every ounce of strength to break free from their grasp. Summoning an inner reserve of willpower, you manage to escape the nightmarish gallery, leaving the haunting figures behind.
